Solutions for the tasks I was given during the Fundamentals of OOP course in the 3 semestr of Applied Computer Science studies at AGH.
The goal of this course was to get a basic knowledge of C++ syntax, overloading operators, usage of constructors/destructors (rule of 0/3/5),
move semantics, inheritance and polymorphism.
